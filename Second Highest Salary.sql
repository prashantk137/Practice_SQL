Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+

Schema :-

Create table If Not Exists Employee (id int, salary int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('1', '100')
insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('2', '200')
insert into Employee (id, salary) values ('3', '300')

Answer :-

Method 1 -

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
with cte as(
    select  distinct salary,
    dense_rank() over(order by salary desc) as rnk
    from Employee
)
select case when exists(select 1 from cte where rnk=2) then (select salary from cte where rnk =2) 
else null 
end as SecondHighestSalary;

Mehtod 2 -

select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from Employee
where salary < (select max(salary) from Employee);
